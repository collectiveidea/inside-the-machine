<p>Modern computers come in all shapes and sizes, and they aid us in a million different types of tasks ranging from the serious, like air traffic control and cancer research, to the not-so-serious, like computer gaming and photograph retouching.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But as diverse as computers are in their outward forms and in the uses to which they’re put, they’re all amazingly similar in basic function.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> All of them rely on a limited repertoire of technologies that enable them do the myriad kinds of miracles we’ve come to expect from them.</p>
<p>At the heart of the modern computer is the <em>microprocessor</em>–also commonly called the <em>central processing unit (CPU)</em>–a tiny, square sliver of silicon that’s etched with a microscopic network of gates and channels through which electricity flows.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This network of gates (<em>transistors</em>) and channels (<em>wires</em> or <em>lines</em>) is a very small version of the kind of circuitry that we’ve all seen when cracking open a television remote or an old radio.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In short, the microprocessor isn’t just the “heart” of a modern computer–it’s a computer in and of itself.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Once you understand how this tiny computer works, you’ll have a thorough grasp of the fundamental concepts that underlie all of modern computing, from the aforementioned air traffic control system to the silicon brain that controls the brakes on a luxury car.</p>
<p>This chapter will introduce you to the microprocessor, and you’ll begin to get a feel for just how straightforward computers really are.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> You need master only a few fundamental concepts before you explore the micro- processor technologies detailed in the later chapters of this book.</p>
<p>To that end, this chapter builds the general conceptual framework on which I’ll hang the technical details covered in the rest of the book.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Both newcomers to the study of computer architecture and more advanced readers are encouraged to read this chapter all the way through, because its abstractions and generalizations furnish the large conceptual “boxes” in which I’ll later place the specifics of particular architectures.</p>

</div><p>To illustrate this point, imagine that one of those little black boxes in the code stream of <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#fig-1-1" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.1</span></a> is an addition operator (a + sign) and that two of the white data boxes contain two integers to be added together, as shown in <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#fig-1-2" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.2</span></a>.</p>

<p>You might think of these black-and-white boxes as the keys on a calculator—with the white keys being numbers and the black keys being operators—the gray boxes are the results that appear on the calculator’s screen.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Thus the two input streams (the code stream and the data stream) represent sequences of key presses (arithmetic operator keys and number keys), while the output stream represents the resulting sequence of numbers displayed on the calculator’s screen.</p>
<p>The kind of simple calculation described above represents the sort of thing that we intuitively think computers do: like a pocket calculator, the computer takes numbers and arithmetic operators (such as +, –, ÷, ×, etc.)<span class="intersentencespace"></span> as input, performs the requested operation, and then displays the results.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These results might be in the form of pixel values that make up a rendered scene in a computer game, or they might be dollar values in a financial spreadsheet.</p>

<p>The “calculator” model of computing, while useful in many respects, isn’t the only or even the best way to think about what computers do.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As an alternative, consider the following definition of a computer:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation"><p class="quote">A computer is a device that shuffles numbers around from place to place, reading, writing, erasing, and rewriting different numbers in different locations according to a set of inputs, a fixed set of rules for processing those inputs, and the prior history of all the inputs that the computer has seen since it was last reset, until a predefined set of criteria are met that cause the computer to halt.<span class="intersentencespace"></span></p>
</blockquote><p>We might, after Richard Feynman, call this idea of a computer as a reader, writer, and modifier of numbers the “file-clerk” model of computing (as opposed to the aforementioned calculator model).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the file-clerk model, the computer accesses a large (theoretically infinite) store of sequentially arranged numbers for the purpose of altering that store to achieve a desired result.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Once this desired result is achieved, the computer halts so that the now-modified store of numbers can be read and interpreted by humans.</p>
<p>The file-clerk model of computing might not initially strike you as all that useful, but as this chapter progresses, you’ll begin to understand how important it is.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This way of looking at computers is powerful because it emphasizes the end product of computation rather than the computation itself.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> After all, the purpose of computers isn’t just to compute in the abstract, but to produce usable results from a given data set.</p>
<div class="aside" id="aside-note_1-2" data-tralics-id="uid4" data-number="1.2"><div class="heading"><span class="number">Box 1.2.</span> 
</div>
<p class="noindent">Those who’ve studied computer science will recognize in the preceding description the beginnings of a discussion of a Turing machine.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The Turing machine is, however, too abstract for our purposes here, so I won’t actually describe one.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The description that I develop here sticks closer to the classic Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) load-store model, where the computer is “fixed” along with the storage.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The Turing model of a computer as a movable read-write head (with a state table) traversing a linear “tape” is too far from real-life hardware organization to be anything but confusing in this discussion.</p>

</div><p>In other words, what matters in computing is not that you did some math, but that you started with a body of numbers, applied a sequence of operations to it, and got a body of results.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Those results could, again, represent pixel values for a rendered scene or an environmental snapshot in a weather simulation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Indeed, the idea that a computer is a device that transforms one set of numbers into another should be intuitively obvious to anyone who has ever used a Photoshop filter.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Once we understand computers not in terms of the math they do, but in terms of the numbers they move and modify, we can begin to get a fuller picture of how they operate.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, a computer is a device that reads, modifies, and writes sequences of numbers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These three functions–read, modify, and write–are the three most fundamental functions that a computer performs, and all of the machine’s components are designed to aid in carrying them out.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This read-modify-write sequence is actually inherent in the three central bullet points of our initial file-clerk definition of a computer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Here is the sequence mapped explicitly onto the file-clerk definition:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation"><p class="quote">A computer is a device that shuffles numbers around from place to place, reading, writing, erasing, and rewriting different numbers in different locations according to a set of inputs [read], a fixed set of rules for processing those inputs [modify], and the prior history of all the inputs that the computer has seen since it was last reset [write], until a predefined set of criteria are met that cause the computer to halt.<span class="intersentencespace"></span></p>
</blockquote><p>That sums up what a computer does.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> And, in fact, that’s all a computer does.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Whether you’re playing a game or listening to music, everything that’s going on under the computer’s hood fits into this model.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent">All of this is fairly simple so far, and I’ve even been a bit repetitive with the explanations to drive home the basic read-modify-write structure of all computer operations.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s important to grasp this structure in its simplicity, because as we increase our computing model’s level of complexity, we’ll see this structure repeated at every level.</p>

</div>
<div id="uid6" data-tralics-id="uid6" class="subsection" data-number="1.2.1"><h3><a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#uid6" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">1.2.1 </span>The Stored-Program Computer</a></h3>
<p>All computers consist of at least three fundamental types of structures needed
to carry out the read-modify-write sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage
To say that a computer “reads” and “writes” numbers implies that there is at least one number-holding structure that it reads from and writes to.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> All computers have a place to put numbers–a storage area that can be read from and written to.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Arithmetic logic unit (ALU)
Similarly, to say that a computer “modifies” numbers implies that the computer contains a device for performing operations on numbers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This device is the ALU, and it’s the part of the computer that performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, and so on), on numbers from the storage area.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> First, numbers are read from storage into the ALU’s data input port.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Once inside the ALU, they’re modified by means of an arithmetic calculation, and then they’re written back to storage via the ALU’s output port.
<p>The ALU is actually the green, three-port device at the center of Figure 1-1.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Note that ALUs aren’t normally understood as having a code input port along with their data input port and results output port.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> They do, of course, have command input lines that let the computer specify which operation the ALU is to carry out on the data arriving at its data input port, so while the depiction of a code input port on the ALU in Figure 1-1 is unique, it is not misleading.<span class="intersentencespace"></span></p>
</li>
<li>Bus
In order to move numbers between the ALU and storage, some means of transmitting numbers is required.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Thus, the ALU reads from and writes to the data storage area by means of the <em>data bus</em>, which is a network of transmission lines for shuttling numbers around inside the computer.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instructions travel into the ALU via the <em>instruction bus</em>, but we won’t cover how instructions arrive at the ALU until Chapter 2.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For now, the data bus is the only bus that concerns us.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
<p>The code stream in <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#fig-1-1" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.1</span></a> flows into the ALU in the form of a sequence of arithmetic instructions (add, subtract, multiply, and so on).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The operands for these instructions make up the data stream, which flows over the data bus from the storage area into the ALU. As the ALU carries out operations on the incoming operands, the results stream flows out of the ALU and back into the storage area via the data bus.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This process continues until the code stream stops coming into the ALU. <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#fig-1-3" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.3</span></a> expands on <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#fig-1-1" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.1</span></a> and shows the storage area.</p>
<p>The data enters the ALU from a special storage area, but where does the code stream come from?<span class="intersentencespace"></span> One might imagine that it comes from the keypad of some person standing at the computer and entering a sequence of instructions, each of which is then transmitted to the code input port of the ALU, or perhaps that the code stream is a prerecorded list of instructions that is fed into the ALU, one instruction at a time, by some manual or automated mechanism.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#fig-1-3" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.3</span></a> depicts the code stream as a prerecorded list of instructions that is stored in a special storage area just like the data stream, and modern computers do store the code stream in just such a manner.</p>

</div>
<p class="noindent">More advanced readers might notice that in <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#fig-1-3" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.3</span></a> (and in <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#fig-1-4" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.4</span></a> later) I’ve separated the code and data in main memory after the manner of a Harvard architecture level-one cache.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In reality, blocks of code and data are mixed together in main memory, but for now I’ve chosen to illustrate them as logically separated.</p>

</div><p>The modern computer’s ability to store and reuse prerecorded sequences of commands makes it fundamentally different from the simpler calculating machines that preceded it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Prior to the invention of the first <em>stored-program computer</em>,:<sup id="cha-1_footnote-ref-1" class="footnote"><a href="#cha-1_footnote-1">1</a></sup> all computing devices, from the abacus to the earliest electronic computing machines, had to be manipulated by an operator or group of operators who manually entered a particular sequence of commands each time they wanted to make a particular calculation.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In contrast, modern computers store and reuse such command sequences, and as such they have a level of flexibility and usefulness that sets them apart from everything that has come before.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In the rest of this chapter, you’ll get a first-hand look at the many ways that the stored-program concept affects the design and capabilities of the modern computer.</p>

<div id="uid13" data-tralics-id="uid13" class="subsection" data-number="1.2.2"><h3><a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#uid13" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">1.2.2 </span>Refining the File-Clerk Model</a></h3>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at the relationship between the code, data, and results streams by means of a quick example.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In this example, the code stream consists of a single instruction, an add, which tells the ALU to add two numbers together.</p>
<p>The add instruction travels from code storage to the ALU. For now, let’s not concern ourselves with how the instruction gets from code storage to the ALU; let’s just assume that it shows up at the ALU’s code input port announcing that there is an addition to be carried out immediately.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The ALU goes through the following sequence of steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain the two numbers to be added (the input operands) from data storage.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Add the numbers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Place the results back into data storage.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ol>
<p>The preceding example probably sounds simple, but it conveys the basic
manner in which computers–<em>all</em> computers–operate.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Computers are fed
a sequence of instructions one by one, and in order to execute them, the computer must first obtain the necessary data, then perform the calculation specified by the instruction, and finally write the result into a place where the end user can find it.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Those three steps are carried out billions of times per second on a modern CPU, again and again and again.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s only because the computer executes these steps so rapidly that it’s able to present the illusion that something much more conceptually complex is going on.</p>
<p>To return to our file-clerk analogy, a computer is like a file clerk who sits at his desk all day waiting for messages from his boss.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Eventually, the boss sends him a message telling him to perform a calculation on a pair of numbers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The message tells him which calculation to perform, and where in his personal filing cabinet the necessary numbers are located.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So the clerk first retrieves the numbers from his filing cabinet, then performs the calculation, and finally places the results back into the filing cabinet.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> It’s a boring, mindless task that’s repeated endlessly, day in and day out, which is precisely why we’ve invented a machine that can do it efficiently and not complain.</p>
</div></div>
<div id="cid4" data-tralics-id="cid4" class="section" data-number="1.3"><h2><a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#cid4" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">1.3 </span>The Register File</a></h2>
<p>Since numbers must first be fetched from storage before they can be added, we want our data storage space to be as fast as possible so that the operation can be carried out quickly.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Since the ALU is the part of the processor that does the actual addition, we’d like to place the data storage as close as possible to the ALU so it can read the operands almost instantaneously.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> However, practical considerations, such as a CPU’s limited surface area, constrain the size of the storage area that we can stick next to the ALU. This means that in real life, most computers have a relatively small number of very fast data storage locations attached to the ALU. These storage locations are called <em>registers</em>, and the first x86 computers only had eight of them to work with.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These registers, which are arrayed in a storage structure called a <em>register file</em>, store only a small subset of the data that the code stream needs (and we’ll talk about where the rest of that data lives shortly).</p>
<p>Building on our previous, three-step description of what goes on when a computer’s ALU is commanded to add two numbers, we can modify it as follows.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To execute an <code>add</code> instruction, the ALU must perform these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain the two numbers to be added (the <em>input operands</em>) from two <em>source registers</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Add the numbers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Place the results back in a <em>destination register</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ol>
<p>For a concrete example, let’s look at addition on a simple computer
with only four registers, named <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>D</code>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Suppose each of these registers contains a number, and we want to add the contents of two registers together and overwrite the contents of a third register with the resulting sum, as in the following operation:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">B</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">C</span> <span class="c1"># Add the contents of registers A and B, and place the result in C,</span>
          <span class="c1"># overwriting whatever was there.</span>
</pre></div></div>
<p>Upon receiving an instruction commanding it to perform this addition operation, the ALU in our simple computer would carry out the following three familiar steps:
1.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Read the contents of registers <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> 2.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Add the contents of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> 3.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Write the result to register <code>C</code>.</p>
<div class="aside" id="aside-note_1-4" data-tralics-id="uid20" data-number="1.5"><div class="heading"><span class="number">Box 1.5.</span> 
</div>
<p class="noindent">You should recognize these three steps as a more specific form of the read-modify-write sequence from earlier, where the generic modify step is replaced with an addition operation.</p>

</div><p>This three-step sequence is quite simple, but it’s at the very core of how a microprocessor really works.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In fact, if you glance ahead to <a href="#cha-arm_3" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">2.5</span></a>’s discussion of the TKTK’s pipeline, you’ll see that it actually has separate stages for each of these three operations: stage TK is the register read step, stage TK is the actual execute step, and stage TK is the write-back step.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (Don’t worry if you don’t know what a <em>pipeline</em> is, because that’s a topic for <a href="the_mechanics_of_program_execution.html#cha-pipelined_execution" class="hyperref">Chapter <span class="ref">2.5</span></a>.)<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So the TKTK’s ALU reads two operands from the register file, adds them together, and writes the sum back to the register file.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> If we were to stop our discussion right here, you’d already understand the three core stages of the TKTK’s main integer pipeline–all the other stages are either just preparation to get to this point or they’re cleanup work after it.</p>

<p>Obviously, four (or even eight) registers aren’t even close to the theoretically infinite storage space I mentioned earlier in this chapter.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In order to make a viable computer that does useful work, you need to be able to store very large
data sets.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This is where the computer’s <em>main memory</em> comes in.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Main memory, which in modern computers is always some type of <em>random access memory</em> (RAM), stores the data set on which the computer operates, and only a small portion of that data set at a time is moved to the registers for easy access from the ALU (as shown in <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#fig-1-4" class="hyperref">Figure <span class="ref">1.4</span></a>).</p>

<p>To translate this office example into computing terms, let’s look at how the computer uses main memory, the register file, and the ALU to add two numbers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> To add two numbers stored in main memory, the computer must perform these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load the two operands from main memory into the two source registers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Add the contents of the source registers and place the results in the destination register, using the ALU. To do so, the ALU must perform these steps:
<ul>
<li>Read the contents of registers A and B into the ALU’s input ports.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Add the contents of A and B in the ALU.
</li>
<li>Write the result to register C via the ALU’s output port.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Store the contents of the destination register in main memory.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ol>
<p>Since steps 2a, 2b, and 2c all take a trivial amount of time to complete,
relative to steps 1 and 3, we can ignore them.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Hence our addition looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load the two operands from main memory into the two source registers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li>
<li>Add the contents of the source registers, and place the results in the des- tination register, using the ALU.
</li>
<li>Store the contents of the destination register in main memory.<span class="intersentencespace"></span>
</li></ol>
<p>The existence of main memory means that the user—the boss in our
filing-clerk analogy—must manage the flow of information between main memory and the CPU’s registers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This means that the user must issue instructions to more than just the processor’s ALU; he or she must also issue instructions to the parts of the CPU that handle memory traffic.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Thus, the preceding three steps are representative of the kinds of instruc- tions you find when you take a close look at the code stream.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this chapter, I defined the code stream as consisting of “an ordered sequence of operations,” and this definition is fine as far as it goes.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But in order to dig deeper, we need a more detailed picture of what the code stream is and how it works.</p>
<p>The term <em>operations</em> suggests a series of simple arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction, but the code stream consists of more than just arithmetic operations.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Therefore, it would be better to say that the code stream consists of an ordered sequence of <em>instructions</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instructions, generally speaking, are commands that tell the whole computer—not just the ALU, but multiple parts of the machine—exactly what actions to perform.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> As we’ve seen, a computer’s list of potential actions encompasses more than just simple arithmetic operations.</p>

<p>Instructions are grouped into ordered lists that, when taken as a whole,
tell the different parts of the computer how to work together to perform a specific task, like grayscaling an image or playing a media file.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> These ordered lists of instructions are called <em>programs</em>, and they consist of a few basic types of instructions.</p>
<p>In modern RISC microprocessors, the act of moving data between memory and the registers is under the explicit control of the code stream, or program.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So if a programmer wants to add two numbers that are located in main memory and then store the result back in main memory, he or she must write a list of instructions (a program) to tell the computer exactly what to do.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The program must consist of</p>
<p>􏰀* a load instruction to move the two numbers from memory into the registers
􏰀* an add instruction to tell the ALU to add the two numbers
􏰀* a store instruction to tell the computer to place the result of the addition
back into memory, overwriting whatever was previously there.</p>
<p>These operations fall into two main categories:
#### Arithmetic instructions
These instructions tell the ALU to perform an arithmetic calculation (for example, <code>add</code>, <code>sub</code>, <code>mul</code>, <code>div</code>).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> #### Memory-access instructions
These instructions tell the parts of the processor that deal with main memory to move data from and to main memory (for example, load and store).</p>

</div><p>The <em>arithmetic instruction</em> fits with our calculator metaphor and is the type of instruction most familiar to anyone who’s worked with computers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Instructions like integer and floating-point addition, subtraction, multipli- cation, and division all fall under this general category.</p>

<p>The DLW-1 microprocessor consists of an ALU (along with a few other units that I’ll describe later) attached to four registers, named <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>D</code> for convenience.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The DLW-1 is attached to a bank of main memory that’s laid out as a line of 256 memory cells, numbered #0 to #255.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (The number that identifies an individual memory cell is called an <em>address</em>.)</p>

<p>All of the DLW-1’s arithmetic instructions are in the following instruction format:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>instruction source1, source2, destination

<p>There are four parts to this instruction format, each of which is called a <em>field</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The <em>instruction</em> field specifies the type of operation being performed (for example, an addition, a subtraction, a multiplication, and so on).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The two <em>source</em> fields tell the computer which registers hold the two numbers being operated on, or the operands.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Finally, the <em>destination</em> field tells the computer which register to place the result in.</p>
<p>As a quick illustration, an addition instruction that adds the numbers in registers <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> (the two source registers) and places the result in register <code>C</code> (the destination register) would look like this:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">add</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">C</span> <span class="c1"># Add the contents of registers A and B and place the result in C,</span>

<p>In order to get the processor to move two operands from main memory into the source registers so they can be added, you need to tell the processor explicitly that you want to move the data in two specific memory cells to two specific registers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> This “filing” operation is done via a memory-access instruction called the <code>load</code>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the <code>load</code> instruction loads the appropriate data from main memory into the appropriate registers so that the data will be available for subsequent arithmetic instructions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The <code>store</code> instruction is the reverse of the load instruction, and it takes data from a register and stores it in a location in main memory, overwriting whatever was there previously.</p>

<p>The examples so far presume that the programmer knows the exact memory location of every number that he or she wants to load and store.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In other words, it presumes that in composing each program, the programmer has at his or her disposal a list of the contents of memory cells #0 through #255.</p>
<p>While such an accurate snapshot of the initial state of main memory may be feasible for a small example computer with only 256 memory locations, such snapshots almost never exist in the real world.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Real computers have billions of possible locations in which data can be stored, so programmers need a more flexible way to access memory, a way that doesn’t require each memory access to specify numerically an exact memory address.</p>
<p>Modern computers allow the <em>contents</em> of a register to be used as a memory address, a move that provides the programmer with the desired flexibility.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> But before discussing the effects of this move in more detail, let’s take one more look at the basic add instruction.</p>
<div id="uid42" data-tralics-id="uid42" class="subsection" data-number="1.6.1"><h3><a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#uid42" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">1.6.1 </span>Immediate Values</a></h3>
<p>All of the arithmetic instructions so far have required two source registers as input.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> However, it’s possible to replace one or both of the source registers with an explicit numerical value, called an <em>immediate value</em>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> For instance, to increase whatever number is in register A by 2, we don’t need to load the value 2 into a second source register, like B, from some cell in main memory that contains that value.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Rather, we can just tell the computer to add 2 to A directly, as follows:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>add A, 2, A  //Add 2 to the contents of register A and place the result back into A, overwriting whatever was there.
</pre></div></div>
<p>I’ve actually been using immediate values all along in my examples, but just not in any arithmetic instructions.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In all of the preceding examples, each load and store uses an immediate value in order to specify a memory address.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> So the #12 in the load instruction in line 1 of <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#code-program-1-1" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.1</span></a> is just an immediate value (a regular whole number) prefixed by a # sign to let the computer know that this particular immediate value is a memory address that designates a cell in memory.</p>
<p>Memory addresses are just regular whole numbers that are specially marked with the # sign.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Because they’re regular whole numbers, they can be stored in registers—and stored in memory—just like any other number.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Thus, the whole-number contents of a register, like <code>D</code>, could be construed by the computer as representing a memory address.</p>
<p>For example, say that we’ve stored the number 12 in register <code>D</code>, and that we intend to use the contents of <code>D</code> as the address of a memory cell in <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#code-program-1-2" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.2</span></a>.</p>

<p>Since the content of <code>D</code> is the number 12, we can tell the computer to look in <code>D</code> for the memory cell address by substituting the register name (this time marked with a # sign for use as an address), for the actual memory cell number in line 1’s <code>load</code> instruction.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Thus, the first lines of <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#code-program-1-1" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.1</span></a> and <a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#code-program-1-2" class="hyperref">Listing <span class="ref">1.2</span></a> are functionally equivalent.</p>

<p>Actually, these capabilities are designed to make programmers’ lives easier, because when used with the register-relative addressing technique described next they make managing code and data traffic between the processor and massive amounts of main memory much less complex.</p>
</div>
<div id="uid45" data-tralics-id="uid45" class="subsection" data-number="1.6.2"><h3><a href="basic_computing_concepts.html#uid45" class="heading hyperref"><span class="number">1.6.2 </span>Register-Relative Addressing</a></h3>
<p>In real-world programs, loads and stores most often use <em>register-relative</em> addressing, which is a way of specifying memory addresses relative to a register that contains a fixed <em>base address</em>.</p>
<p>For example, we’ve been using <code>D</code> to store memory addresses, so let’s say that on the DLW-1 we can assume that, unless it is explicitly told to do otherwise, the operating system always loads the starting address (or base address) of a program’s <em>data segment</em> into <code>D</code>.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Remember that code and data are logically separated in main memory, and that data flows into the processor from a data storage area, while code flows into the processor from a special code storage area.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> Main memory itself is just one long row of undifferentiated memory cells, each one <em>byte</em> in width, that store numbers.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The computer carves up this long row of bytes into multiple segments, some of which store code and some of which store data.</p>
<p>A <em>data segment</em> is a block of contiguous memory cells that a program stores all of its data in, so if a programmer knows a data segment’s starting address (<em>base address</em>) in memory, he or she can access all of the other memory locations in that segment using this formula:
</p><div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>base address + offset
</pre></div></div>
<p>where offset is the distance in bytes of the desired memory location from the data segment’s base address.</p>
<p>Thus, <code>load</code> and <code>store</code> instructions in DLW-1 assembly would normally look something like this:</p>
<div class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre>load #(D + 108), A   //Read the contents of the memory cell at location #(D + 108) into A.
store B, #(D + 108)  //Write the contents of B into the memory cell at location #(D + 108).
</pre></div></div>
<p>In the case of the load, the processor takes the number in D, which is the base address of the data segment, adds 108 to it, and uses the result as the load’s destination memory address.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> The store works in the exact same way.</p>
<p>Of course, this technique requires that a quick addition operation (called an <em>address calculation</em>) be part of the execution of the load instruction, so this is why the <em>load-store units</em> on modern processors contain very fast integer addition hardware.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> (As we’ll learn in Chapter 4, the load-store unit is the <em>execution unit</em> responsible for executing <code>load</code> and <code>store</code> instructions, just like the <em>arithmetic-logic unit</em> is responsible for executing arithmetic instructions.)</p>
<p>By using register-relative addressing instead of <em>absolute addressing</em> (in which memory addresses are given as immediate values), a programmer can write programs without knowing the exact location of data in memory.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> All the programmer needs to know is which register the operating system will place the data segment’s base address in, and he or she can do all memory accesses relative to that base address.<span class="intersentencespace"></span> In situations where a programmer uses absolute addressing, when the operating system loads the program into memory, all of the program’s immediate address values have to be changed to reflect the data segment’s actual location in memory.</p>
<p>Because both memory addresses and regular integer numbers are stored in the same registers, these registers are called <em>general-purpose registers</em> (GPRs).<span class="intersentencespace"></span> On the DLW-1, A, B, C, and D are all GPRs.</p>
